I am currently serving as a Systems Operations Specialis 1, at Bass Pro Shops Base Camp.

## Objective

My journey within the IT world will be one of growth, and practical hands-on experience. As of right now, my job deals heavily with Incident Response, and I believe this stepping stone will path my way towards my next security adjacent role.
